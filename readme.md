# Overview

Get a feeling for working with Backbone.js modules in the browser.

In this repository, there are two examples provided:
* start: This is an empty application providing minimum stylesheet and HTML to start prototyping. The main JavaScript application including its dependencies are not yet given. This is shown in the other directory.
* browserify: In this example, some Backbone models and collections are packaged with Browserify. Also, it uses JSON data that you can use to explore data in the browser.

If you go to the `browserify` example, you can start to load the pages with a static web server:

    $ ss .
    Server started on port 3474

Now, you can open a browser and play with the Backbone models from the web browser
